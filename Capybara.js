I can see you have an empty `Capybara.js` file. How would you like me to help you? 

You could ask me to:
- Create a class or function for working with capybaras
- Build a specific feature or component
- Set up a particular pattern or structure

What would you like to implement in this file?
- kapybara 
Consule console.log(Kapybara says hi);
